# üö® NetWatch ‚Äî Network Monitor & Fairwall Helper üõ°Ô∏è

> Lightweight, safe, and admin-friendly toolkit to monitor devices on a Wi‚ÄëFi / LAN and apply host-level firewall blocks.

## ‚ú® Highlights

- üîç **Passive Wi‚ÄëFi monitoring** ‚Äî sniff beacon frames (SSID / BSSID) and client frames (requires interface in monitor mode).
- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **LAN discovery** ‚Äî fast ARP scans and ICMP ping scans for local subnets.
- üßæ **Unified device registry** ‚Äî MAC ‚Üí IP ‚Üí SSID mapping with `last_seen` timestamps.
- üîí **Safe fairwall actions** ‚Äî call OS firewall (iptables on Linux, `netsh` on Windows) to block/unblock IPs.
- üß∞ **Single script, CLI driven** ‚Äî modular flags so you run only the features you need.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Non-invasive** ‚Äî no deauthentication, no ARP spoofing, no packet injection included.

## ‚úÖ Best practices & safety

* Only run discovery & blocking on networks you **own or administer**. Unauthorized scanning or interference can be illegal.
* This project intentionally **excludes** deauthentication, ARP spoofing, or other disruptive attacks. If you need client isolation, prefer router/AP-level blocking.
* Always keep a separate admin session (e.g., wired connection or console) while experimenting with firewall rules.

### Final notes

* Replace `https://github.com/<your-username>/netwatch.git` in the README with your real GitHub URL.
* The Flask UI is intentionally minimal and **must not** be exposed without adding authentication and HTTPS.
* Want me to also add the `netwatch_fairwall.py` full script into this paste? I can add it into the repo file content next.

---

Happy to keep going ‚Äî I can now:

* Add the full `netwatch_fairwall.py` script into the repo (ready to paste),
* Create a ready-to-copy `LICENSE` (MIT),
* Generate a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` basic CI that runs lint/tests.

Tell me which of those you want next and I will add them here.
